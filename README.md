 Presented in paper "Immunoinformatic Design and Evaluation of a Novel Multi-Epitope Peptide Vaccine Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Structural and Nonstructural Antigens"

 This repository contains three directories:
 
 1. /epitopeAnalysis - contains all peptide data gathered from IEDB along with their MHC binding affinities, also contains python scripts used for gathering MHC allele types and overall descriptive statistics
 2. /MHC_binding - contains python scripts used for calling IEDB API to get MHCI and MHCII binding affinities
 3. proteinStructureRaptor - results from RaptorX AI algorithms, structure files in PDB format
