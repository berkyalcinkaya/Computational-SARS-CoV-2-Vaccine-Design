0README             : This README file.

seqid		    : The ID assigned by RaptorX Server to the query sequence

contactmap.txt	    : If exists, this file has the predicted contact and distance probability distribution. Please consult https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/index.cgi?page=format#RR for its format

seqid_model_X.pdb   : The predicted five 3D models in PDB format, where X ranges from 1 to 5

seqid.model_summary : The file contains estimated error in Angstrom of the predicted 3D models, which may not be accurate for a multi-domain protein

seqid_modelX.localQuality.txt : the file contains estimated error at each Ca atom in Angstrom. Again, it may not be accurate for a multi-domain protein
